# AVR Path Finder

## Introduction

This project aims at making an autonomous navigation robot which moves from source to destination in a 6x6 grid while avoiding the obstacles in its way. It is equipped with:

- 1 HC SR-04 sensor for obstacle detection
- 2 Optical encoders for odometry
- 2 DC motors for motion
- 1 AVR ATmega16a microcontroller for processing

## Methodology

The project is divided into 3 parts:

- **Path Planning** - The robot is given a source and destination and it finds the shortest path between them using the A\* algorithm.
- **Path Following** - The robot follows the path generated by the A\* algorithm using the optical encoders for odometry.
- **Obstacle Avoidance** - The robot uses the HC SR-04 sensor to detect obstacles in its path and avoid them.

The pipeline forms a closed loop system. The robot starts from the source and follows the path generated by the A\* algorithm. If an obstacle is detected, the robot stops and generates a new path to the destination. This process is repeated until the robot reaches the destination.

Following are the schematics of the robot:
